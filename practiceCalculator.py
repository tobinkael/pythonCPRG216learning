#Calculator Practice


num1 = input("Enter First Number")
num2 = input('Enter Second Number')

#Conversion for the integers as they come in as plain text
num1 = int(num1)
num2 = int(num2)

#addition lines
result = num1 + num2

#show result line
print("The answer is:", result)

#anti-crash if some jokah types in a word instead of a number like "hello"

num1 = int(input("enter First Number"))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number"))
result = num1 + num2
print("The answer is:", result)


#AHHHH THE DEBUGGER ISNT WORKING

#will try again later
#did a google and it turns out TRY and EXCEPT are like a pair
